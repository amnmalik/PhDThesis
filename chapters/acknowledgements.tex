\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
The foremost person I want to thank is Christoph Bertram. He was patient with my mistakes, prompt at providing feedback, always made time for discussions, gave opportunities to contribute to papers, and eventually transferred essential skills to me to be a better researcher. I honestly don't know how he put up with me for so long, I sure would have given up.

I am thankful to Julius, Johanna, Felix, and Sandra for always lending me a sympathetic ear. Their kindness and generosity helped me through hard times. To Sebastian, for cycling adventures, both big and small, which made the whole PhD more bearable. To Luise and Lukas and their families, down south, for having their house always open to me. It provided a ready getaway when most needed. 

To my family - my parents and my sister, for their support in willing me to go all the way.

To Elmar Kriegler and Gunnar Luderer, for mentoring me through the whole phase and supporting me with my decisions. 

To the people who took time to provide comments on the manuscript and spotted grammatical and typing mistakes : Julius Garbe, Oliver Richters, Kais Sala, Sebastian Rauner, and Felix Schreyer.
